  abstract = {SENORA is an open hardware and software architecture for the cooperative
	coordination of multiple heterogeneous mobile robots operating in
	a common environment. It is designed to meet the stringent requirements
	of modern loosely coupled multirobot architectures, such as flexibility,
	reliability, and fault tolerance. As such, the proposed architecture
	enables the robots to cope with the ubiquitous presence of various
	types of uncertainties in their operating environments. SENORA is
	a fully autonomous and scalable sensory-based peer-to-peer (P2P)
	framework. It also offers a real-time inter-robot communication protocol
	and it is based on the state-of-the-art P2P technology, which is
	specifically designed to satisfy the requirements of physical sensory
	data publishing and fusion. This architecture is implemented and
	evaluated on a team of indoor mobile robots. The test results manifest
	the architecture's distinguished features and capabilities. Â© 2007

  abstract = {The future Internet is driven by applications that require simultaneous
	access to multiple heterogeneous IT resources interconnected by high-speed
	optical network. Current research on network and IT resource co-allocation
	address advanced reservations in which each resource-type is optimised
	independently. However, emerging applications demand a resource co-allocation
	model that views and optimizes multiple heterogeneous resources in
	a holistic manner. A common platform such as the service plane facilitates
	such a holistically optimised resource allocation model. In this
	paper, we propose a new efficient online algorithm that views heterogeneous
	resource-types in a holistic manner. The proposed service-oriented
	resource allocation model is based on optimised co-scheduling of
	heterogeneous resources owned by different infrastructure providers.
	The optimised co-scheduling algorithm aims to serve a higher number
	of end-users while balancing the load over the multiple resource-types.
	For this purpose, we introduce a weighted scheduling cost that relies
	on the simultaneous identification of available resources of each
	resource-type. The proposed model aims to optimise the efficiency
	and performance from both the end-users' and infrastructure providers'
	point of view. A mathematical formulation in the form of an Integer
	Linear Programming (ILP) is presented to benchmark the performance
	of the algorithm. Simulations are run to confirm the scalability
	of the algorithm. The algorithm is also compared against existing
	resource allocation schemes. Â© 2010 IEEE.},

	Consequently, if from a technological view an AmI system can be considered

	FMS at SOCIESC (Joinville), and Lathe at UFSC (Florianopolis). The
	proposed methodology includes planning, scheduling, control, and
	remote manufacturing of parts. The user (customer) uses the manufacturing
	services based on the SOA (Service Oriented Application) provided
	by the WebMachining virtual company through the Internet, in order
	to execute operations and processes to design and manufacture the
	parts. The proposed methodology integrates engineering and manufacturing
	management through an ERP software that will preview which of the
	three systems will produce the ordered part, and this decision is
	based on parameters related to each of the three systems. After the
	decision, the ERP system will generate the production schedule. Also
	in this work the implementation aspects of a web-based shop floor
	controller for the FMC at Graco/UnB are presented. The FMC consists
	of a Romi Galaxy 15M turning center, an ASEA IRB6 robot manipulator,
	a Mitutoyo LSM-6100 laser micrometer, an AGV, and a pallet to store
	the blank and finished parts. The functional model, which depicts

  abstract = {The wide-spread phenomenon of software (running image) aging is known
	to cause performance degradation, transient failures or even crashes
	of applications. In this work we describe first a method for monitoring
	and modeling of performance degradation in SOA applications, particularly
	application servers. This method works for a large class of the aging
	processes caused by resource depletion (e.g. memory leaks). It can
	be deployed non-intrusively in a production environment, under arbitrary
	service request distributions. Based on this schema we investigate
	in the second part of the paper how machine learning (classification)
	algorithms can be used for proactive detection of performance degradation
	or sudden drops caused by aging. We leverage the predictive power
	of these algorithms with several techniques to make the measurement-based
	aging models more adaptive and more robust against transient failures.
	We evaluate several state-of-the-art classification methods for their
	accuracy and computational efficiency in this scenario. The studies
	are performed on a data set generated by a TPC-W benchmark instrumented
	with a memory leak injector. The results show that the probing method
	yields accurate aging models with low overhead and the machine learning
	approach gives statistically significant short-term predictions of
	degrading application performance. Both approaches can be used directly
	to fight aging via adaptive software rejuvenation (restart of the
	application), for operator alerting, or for short-term capacity planning.

	service-oriented virtual based at the University of learning environment,
	enabling teachers to create an integrated teaching environment using
	tools that Leeds, Leeds, UK.have been chosen to best meet their academic
	requirements. Design/methodology/approach - This is an implementation
	of a WAFFLE Bus. A microkernel software design pattern is used to
	enable tools to be added and removed from the system. An enterprise
	service bus is used to provide workflow and message transformation
	functionality. Tools are managed through web service interfaces and
	Shibboleth is used to effect interoperability at the web application
	user interface. The initial services for the prototype were chosen
	to implement a simple web service teaching workflow. Findings - First,
	Shibboleth is shown to provide a solution to the virtual learning
	environment tools' interoperability problem. Second, the service-oriented
	virtual learning environment naturally leads to the ability to operate
	with many different types of information channels in and out of the
	system. This leads to a multiplicity of possible types of context-dependent
	user interface. Third, immersive 3D, possibly the most interesting
	interface, will provide a context amenable to even the smallest development
	teams for the introduction of artificial intelligence into teaching.
	Finally, web service workflow is shown to provide a viable option
	for the implementation of learning designs with advantages and disadvantages
	compared to existing approaches. Research limitations/implications
	- Different types of information channels are associated with different
	security problems. It will be important to determine what the best
	ways are of establishing secure channels to student personal learning
	environments. The present web service workflow design tools are of
	the highest quality and usability, but the design process is still
	a job for a specialist. It might be possible, however, to modify
	these open source tools to bring the design process within the grasp
	of non-specialists. Originality/value - The software system presented
	herein represents one possible path leading away from VLE monolithy
	using a service-oriented approach. A new solution to the tools' interoperability
	problem is presented along with a multi-faceted approach to the user
	interface. The enterprise service bus creates a flexible platform
	for the delivery of web service teaching and learning workflows.
	It is posited that the use of an immersive 3D user interface will
	create a context that facilitates the introduction of an artificial
	intelligence layer into the virtual learning environment that can
	serve robot teaching avatars. Â© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	include similarities comparisons both on signature level and behavior

	web services are atomic. However, for composite web services with
	complicated internal structures, the precision of similarity results
	depends on the comparison approaches. To enhance this precision for
	composite services, the paper proposes a two-stage framework to integrate
	the signature level and behavior level similarities. The first stage
	adopts the traditional WordNet-based interface measuring method to
	generate a set of possible similar services. Then in the second stage,
	an automaton is built for each service. By characterizing and comparing
	the languages generated from those automata, we can enhance the precision
	of similarity measures of similar services from the previous stage.

	technology, a new class of networked robots - ubiquitous robots -
	has been introduced. The URC (Ubiquitous Robotic Companion) is our
	conceptual vision of ubiquitous robot which provides me with the
	services I need, anytime and anywhere. To realize the vision of URC,
	it is one of the most important requirements for the robotic systems
	to support seamlessness of services even though service environments
	changes. Specifically, it is needed for robotic systems to be interoperable
	with the sensors and devices in current service environments automatically,
	rather than statically preprogrammed for them. In this paper, we
	present SURF (Service-oriented Ubiquitous Robotic Framework) which
	enables automated integration of networked robots into ubiquitous
	computing environments based on the Semantic Web Services technology.
	In SURF approach, we implement interfaces for robots, networked sensors
	and devices as Web Services. And we describe knowledge about them
	in OWL-S the Semantic Web Services ontology and register the knowledge
	to KB, so that a SURF agent can automatically discover required knowledge
	and compose a feasible service plan for the service environments.
	And then the agent controls robots, sensors and devices through SOAP
	the Web Services execution protocol according to the service plan.

  abstract = {Bridge management systems have proved to be of great value for developing
	preservation strategies, understanding life-cycle costs, and analyzing
	the benefits and costs at the alternatives at the project and program
	levels. However, a critical issue in using bridge management systems
	to address broader asset management needs is that an agency must
	integrate results generated from bridge management systems with results
	from other asset management systems in making tradeoff decisions.
	National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 20-57
	was undertaken to provide new analytical tools to support asset management.
	The project's research objectives emphasize the need for tools that
	help agencies to make the difficult tradeoff decisions for resource
	allocation while considering both asset preservation concerns as
	well as the broader set of policy objectives (e.g., safety and economic
	development) that must be taken into account when making investments
	in transportation assets. This paper describes a new analytical tool
	developed as part of the project, AssetManager NT. The system works
	with 10- to 20-year simulation results from existing asset management
	systems and allows users to explore the consequences of different
	levels of investment within and across asset classes. AssetManager
	NT is analogous to a data warehouse for simulation results. It provides
	an interpolation engine, together with a set of business intelligence
	data exploration capabilities that operate on these simulation results
	so that program managers can quickly and easily understand the relationship
	between expenditure levels and performance across multiple dimensions.
	Dimensions in AssetManager NT are: time (up to 20 single or multi-year
	periods), asset classes (e.g. pavement and bridges), geographic areas
	(e.g. districts or regions), and network subsets (e.g. based on functional
	class or ownership). For example, the tool can be used to understand
	how bridge and pavement condition on trunkline routes in the urbanized
	portion of a state might be expected to change over the next 10 years
	given different allocations of the budget across these two asset
	classes. Some currently available infrastructure management systems
	provide built-in capabilities to explore simulation results, and
	off-the-shelf commercial asset management solutions are available
	that provide integrated analysis capabilities for multiple asset
	classes. AssetManager NT addresses the needs of agencies wishing
	to stay with existing tool sets and/or leave the door open for future
	implementation of best-of-breed tools that have an appropriate level
	of sophistication for specific asset classes. AssetManager NT does
	not attempt to implement a consistent approach to deterioration modeling,
	treatment selection or optimization across asset classes. Rather,
	the tool serves a single function - investment vs. performance what-if
	analysis. This is in keeping with a modular, service-oriented approach
	to software architecture. It also recognizes that there are typically
	distinct user communities for asset management tools - one concerned
	in more detailed technical aspects of treatment selection and project
	prioritization; the other concerned with higher-level resource allocation
	tradeoffs. Figure 1 presents the key organizing concepts of AssetManager
	NT. Using AssetManager NT involves a three step process: running
	simulations in external tools and creating input files, using (Figure
	Presented) the AssetManager NT preprocessor to create a scenario
	file, and finally, conducting what-if analysis for a given AssetManager
	NT scenario. Companion "robot" tools also were developed to produce
	inputs needed by AssetManager NT from systems such as the American
	Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)
	Pontis Bridge Management System. AssetManager NT was tested at New
	York and Montana state DOTs. After reviewing the system, staff at
	both agencies observed that AssetManager NT was a useful tool that
	could be used both in the context of periodic long-range infrastructure
	needs analysis (for long range plan updates), as well as for the
	annual program development cycle. Both states have embraced performance-based
	planning and programming, and were therefore very receptive to tools
	that could support their established business processes for making
	budget decisions based on performance tradeoffs. Both of these agencies
	were already analyzing infrastructure investment tradeoffs, but AssetManager
	NT makes this process easier. The testing process highlighted some
	limitations of AssetManager NT. First, for some types of assets -
	notably bridges, expenditures tend to be "lumpy", i.e. there are
	a relatively small number of high cost treatments that must be done
	on an all-or-nothing basis. In this context, performance predictions
	obtained from piecewise linear interpolation may not be realistic
	in certain circumstances. A second limitation is that the tool works
	only with aggregated performance results, and users can not drill
	down to specific projects or assets that underlie these results.
	A new project being launched by the American Association of State
	Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) AASHTOW are program
	will implement the current version of AssetManager NT in ten state
	DOTs and then develop a plan for future enhancement of the tool.
	Enhancements will be determined based on input from the participating
	agencies. Some of these enhancements may address the limitations
	discussed above that were identified in the initial testing process.
	It is likely that changes to the tool's software architecture and
	platform will be made as well - the tool is currently a stand-alone
	desktop application. The AASHTOW are project will also encompass
	a second tool developed in NCHRP Project 20-57 - AssetManager PT,
	which works with a list of proposed projects and addresses shorter
	range tradeoff questions. Integration of the NT and PT tools will
	be explored as one way to address the desire for additional drill-down
	capabilities. Â© 2006 Taylor & Francis Group.},

	A robust, manageable, distributed infrastructure is absolutely necessary

	provides the capability of supporting message-oriented middleware,
	and eventdriven integration, as well as the capability of supporting
	service routing and substitution, protocol transformations, and other
	message processing. These requirements are consistent with the principles
	of SOA. This paper tries to provide a novel SOA-oriented E-learning

	sources. This will enhance interoperability, independence of operation,
	and situation awareness of the embedded service-oriented agents for
	autonomous platforms. The results obtained specifically affect the
	mission flexibility, robustness, and autonomy. The presented framework
	makes use of the idea that heterogeneous real-world data of very
	different type must be processed by (and run through) several different
	layers, to be finally available in a suited format and at the right
	place to be accessible by high-level decision-making agents. In this
	sense, the presented approach shows how to abstract away from the
	raw real-world data step by step by means of semantic technologies.
	The paper concludes by demonstrating the benefits of the framework
	in a real scenario. A hardware fault is simulated in a REMUS 100
	AUV while performing a mission. This triggers a knowledge exchange
	between the status monitoring agent and the adaptive mission planner
	embedded agent. By using the proposed framework, both services can
	interchange information while remaining domain independent during

	control over the intelligent product. Examples of such systems can
	be exploited in many domains like team robotics, factory automation,

	inherent complexity, we present a layered system architecture that
	partly integrates already existing components. It has to cope with
	two major challenges imposed by the considered type of applications.
	First, the architecture has to resolve the conflict between the autonomy
	of the individual systems and the demand to cooperate. We think that
	coordination is the key to the required effective cooperation. Coordination
	means that the individual systems Can take actions under local control,
	based on a sufficiently consistent view of the common system environment
	and on the application of a set of common rules. To enable this,
	the proposed architecture provides the necessary communication services.
	Secondly, system control must be prepared to cope with a dynamic
	and unpredictable system environment. Still guaranteeing QoS properties,
	especially real-time behavior, necessitates innovative solution concepts.
	Our approach is to exploit system - and application - inherent redundancies
	across different layers of the architecture.},

	mission flexibility, robustness and autonomy. The presented framework
	makes use of the idea that heterogeneous real-world data of very

	between the incipient fault diagnosis agent and the adaptive mission

	of integrated medical devices support improvements in workflow and
	reductions in medical errors and healthcare costs to the benefit
	of patients throughout the continuum of care. Methods: Interoperability
	is achieved using a middleware for ubiquitous computing based on
	a service-oriented architecture. Connected devices provide services
	that can be composed dynamically to achieve extended functionality.
	We created a dynamic service composition system that generates high-level
	services based on the information the user provides using natural
	language. The system finds required devices based on a type of semantic
	distance between words and device descriptions and establishes connections
	between devices in order to satisfy the request. Results: One application
	of this approach is an intelligent surgical service where the medical
	doctor uses his voice to control a surgery robot. This scenario is
	experimented by asking the system to compose a service according
	to a medical doctor's request during an appendectomy. Conclusion:
	Combining device functionality in order to satisfy a need expressed
	using a verbal request can be achieved by linking the semantics of
	the request to the computer understanding of a device. Interacting
	with medical equipment through the services they provide as plug-and-play

	Comparing to existing finite state machine and graph-based approaches

	admissible compositions. In our framework, tree automata is used
	to express both type signature constraints of individual services
	as well as constraints on the order in which services must be invoked.
	To synthesize service compositions, users may provide optional specifications
	on the desired composite service. The user specifications are also
	expressed as tree automata. We employ a combination of tree automata
	algorithms to compute the set of all possible valid service compositions
	which satisfy the user specifications. Â©2008 IEEE.},

  abstract = {E-Health services comprise a broad range of healthcare services delivered
	by using information and communication technology. In order to support
	existing as well as emerging e-Health services over converged next
	generation network (NGN) architectures, there is a need for network
	QoS control mechanisms that meet the often stringent requirements
	of such services. In this paper, we evaluate the QoS support for
	e-Health services in the context of the Evolved Packet System (EPS),
	specified by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as a
	multi-access all-IP NGN. We classify heterogeneous e-Health services
	based on context and network QoS requirements and propose a mapping
	to existing 3GPP QoS Class Identifiers (QCIs) that serve as a basis
	for the class-based QoS concept of the EPS. The proposed mapping
	aims to provide network operators with guidelines for meeting heterogeneous
	e-Health service requirements. As an example, we present the QoS
	requirements for a prototype e-Health service supporting tele-consultation
	between a patient and a doctor and illustrate the use of the proposed
	mapping to QCIs in standardized QoS control procedures.},

	planning for combat. That is, we cannot start planning for SARO after
	the enemy regime has fallen. In addition, the studies have shown
	that security, power and jobs are key ingredients for success during
	SARO. It is important to give positions to some of the power players
	from the fallen regime provided they are trustworthy. It is critical
	that investments are made to stimulate the local economies. The studies
	have also analyzed the various technologies that are needed for successfully
	carrying out SARO which includes sensors, robotics and information
	management. In this project we will focus on the information management
	component for SARO. As stated in the work by the Naval Postgraduate
	School, we need to determine the social, political and economic relationships
	between the local communities as well as determine who the important
	people are. This work has also identified the 5Ws (Who, When, What,

	for managing this lifecycle. We are developing techniques for representing

	Tsai, Distributed Service-Oriented Software Development, Kendall/Hunt,
	2008, [4]]. Microsoft Robotics Studio (MSRS) is a recent initiative
	in applying SOA to embedded systems and one of its key features is
	its 3-D simulation tool that allows applications to be simulated
	before deployment. This paper proposes an ontology-based service-oriented
	simulation framework with MSRS by adding a set of ontology systems,
	i.e., service ontology, workflow ontology, entity ontology, and environment
	ontology. These ontology systems store relevant information useful
	to compose simulation applications, and items stored also cross reference
	to each other to facilitate reusability and rapid application composition,
	This paper then provides a detailed case study on a popular robotic
	game Sumobot using MSRS to illustrate the key concepts and how they
	can support rapid simulation development.1The contents of this paper

	research attention has been paid to the management of services, several
	gaps can still be observed. Service management as far as it is automated
	is either mixed up with the operational service logic itself, or
	handled in a separate not service-oriented system, such as a BAM
	platform. In addition, there is a growing business demand for value-driven
	service management. In this paper, a general framework for management
	service design is presented that covers both business services and
	software services and is rooted in the business ontology REA, extended
	with a REA management ontology. The framework is applied to two different
	case studies, one in the Italian wine industry and one related to
	a robot cleaner. Â© 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

	multi-robot system based on manufacturing message specification (MMS)
	and new-generation distributed object technology - web services for
	realizing remotely monitoring and controlling multiple heterogeneous
	robots in the internet environment. Design/methodology/approach -
	The study presents robot communication model and distributed multi-robot
	monitoring and control software structure based on MMS and web services.
	In particular, monitoring and control software design of MMS concepts
	in web services environment using Unified Modeling Language model
	is discussed in detail. In addition, to verify the validity of the
	proposed design method, a multi-robot prototype system for robot
	flexible assemble cell has been achieved. Its Server software is
	implemented in C++ with Visual Studio.NET being the development environment
	and Client software is programmed in Java with Borland JBuilder 9
	being the development tool. Findings - Finds that the communication
	structure following MMS can make the multi-robot monitoring and control
	system have perfect robustness, interoperability and reconfigurability.
	Besides, web services technology can conveniently realize MMS services,
	also can successfully resolve the remote multi-robot monitoring and
	control problem among cross-network, cross-platform and heterogeneous
	systems. Research limitations/implications - Provides an easy and
	low-cost method for realizing heterogeneous multi-robot remote driving.
	The web-based distribution of the presented system is critical in
	enabling capabilities such as e-manufacturing, e-diagnostics and
	e-maintenance. Practical implications - The proposed system can be
	seamlessly integrated into other automated manufacturing systems
	or management systems in plug-and-play fashion. The combination of
	MMS and web services is in favor of real manufacturing equipments
	being embedded in the network, so the presented systematic methodology
	can be a useful reference for constructing web-based reconfigurable
	manufacturing systems. Originality/value - Provides robot communication
	model based on MMS and web services and presents service-oriented
	distributed remote multi-robot monitoring and control software architecture.

  abstract = {As remote sensing technology become ever more powerful with multi-platform
	and multi-sensor, it has been widely recognized for contributing
	to geospatial information efforts. Because the remotely sensed image
	processing demands large-scale, collaborative processing and massive
	storage capabilities to satisfy the increasing demands of various
	applications, the effect and efficiency of the remotely sensed image
	processing is far from the user's expectation. The emergence of Service
	Oriented Architecture (SOA) may make this challenge manageable. It
	encapsulate all processing function into services and recombine them
	with service chain. The service composition on demand has become
	a hot topic. Aiming at the success rate, quality and efficiency of
	processing service composition for remote sensing application, a
	remote sensed image processing service composition method is proposed
	in this paper. It composes services for a user requirement through
	two steps: 1) dynamically constructs a complete service dependency
	graph for user requirement on-line; 2) AO* based heuristic searches
	for optimal valid path in service dependency graph. These services
	within the service dependency graph are considered relevant to the
	specific request, instead of overall registered services. The second
	step, heuristic search is a promising approach for automated planning.
	Starting with the initial state, AO* uses a heuristic function to
	select states until the user requirement is reached. Experimental
	results show that this method has a good performance even the repository
	has a large number of processing services. Â© 2008 SPIE.},

  abstract = {The interest in a healthy and happy life for seniors has increased
	of late as the quality of life in old age has become a hot issue.
	Moreover, the interest in health has led industrial companies to
	concentrate on healthcare technology. Healthcare robot technology
	is one of the biggest issues in the robotics field, and many companies
	and institutes have sought to develop a healthcare robot technology.
	The healthcare robot must have certain abilities that would allow
	it to help a person mentally and/or physically. There is no common
	interface module, however, for healthcare robot platforms, and few
	robots that have healthcare abilities exist. Therefore, developing
	a common interface technology and applying the technology to robot
	platforms can pave the way for the development of a technology that
	could improve the physical and mental health of humans. This paper
	introduces the authors' research on a common interface module and
	a healthcare service robot platform. First, a common interface module
	is one that can be used in common in the healthcare robot area. The
	research on a common interface module contains the following technologies:
	biosignal processing modules; voice signal processing modules, which
	could recognize voice commands; control modules for robot actuators;
	and a human-friendly design for a healthcare system. Lastly, the
	research on a healthcare service robot platform contains three types
	of robot platforms: ChairBot for relaxation, RideBot for exercising,
	and LifecareBot for human emotions. Each robot platform has common
	interface modules for healthcare services and can provide specialized
	intelligent services based on their own objectives. In conclusion,

  abstract = {The concept of learning objects and their usage just-in-time, at the
	precise moment whenever necessary, adapted to the context, is as
	old as technology-enhanced learning itself: The basic limitation
	of films in education is that the filmed material has not been programmed
	properly into the course of study. Only now, twenty years after the
	advent of the technique, are we beginning to think of eight millimeter,
	cartridge load, single concept films for education. Try to visualize
	two to ten minute segments of films, in self-load, self-thread cartridges,
	on the shelf in every classroom so that students or the teacher can
	display a demonstration of a scientific principle, explanation of
	a theorem, or an event in history, anytime during the class or course,
	simply by selecting the proper cartridge and pushing it into a rear
	screen projector. Such could be the potential of filmed material,
	properly programmed, in the future. [170] This quote, from the very
	first international conference on technology-enhanced learning in
	Germany in 1965 paints a future in which learning objects instantiated
	in video cartridges are "programmed" (the predominant jargon at that
	time of behavioristic learning theories) into the course, selected
	by students or teachers. This vision did not include the automatic
	selection of learning objects, albeit the necessary techniques were
	already under investigation for almost a decade. About ten years
	earlier, in 1956, a conference in Dartmouth gave birth to the field
	"Artificial Intelligence". The aim of describing any feature of intelligence
	so precisely that machines can simulate it [98] today include the
	skill of teaching, resulting in applications that support the student
	in various ways while learning. The work in this book describes teaching
	knowledge required for the automatic assembly of courseware in a
	previously unavailable level of detail. A large set of primitives,
	covering basic functionalities such as searching for learning objects,
	inquiring about the learner's competencies, inserting learning objects,
	and others, are formalized. From these basic building blocks, scenarios
	are assembled that support students in achieving complex learning
	goals. This set of pedagogical knowledge is then integrated into
	a Web-based, service-oriented architecture, in order to make this
	valuable expert knowledge available to others. At the same time,
	this work does not marginalize practical considerations. Thorough
	summative and formative evaluations assessed the acceptance of such
	unfamiliar paradigms by students, and technical evaluations made
	sure that the performance is suited for application in the real-world.
	The idea of inserting learning objects just-in-time in a course is
	thus realized - albeit not based on film cartridges. In the following,
	we will start this chapter by putting the above example into the
	world of today, i.e. the world of digital resources. Â© 2008 Springer-Verlag.},
