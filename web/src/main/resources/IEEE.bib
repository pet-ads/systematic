	home domain is not like the robotics domain, we can notice resemblances.
	In V. Ricquebourg et al. (2005), we shown that a smart home can be
	seen as a robot that turn over itself. A robot needs sensors to discover
	its environment. In the same way, a smart home needs sensors to watch
	in itself. This paper deals with a service oriented architecture
	of context perception for the smart home. In our approach, the smart
	house must be able to provide services adapted to the needs for its
	inhabitants. To answer to the needs, the environment, which will
	be described as smart, must take into account the context around
	the inhabitant: it will make it possible to provide contextualised
	services. Here, we present our service oriented architecture which
	integrates the various layers necessary to the determination of this
	context. Four layers are considered. Perception layer to obtain necessary
	information on the context, the context layer which makes it possible
	to give a sense to the perceived data, the inference layer which
	makes it possible to elaborate an artificial intelligence layer and
	to reason on the contextual data and the action layer which makes
	it possible to act following the decisions induced by the inference
	layer},
